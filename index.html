                    <hr> The tyrannical demon king "the misfit" shows the trajectory he will endeavor in this new era.

                    The one that has appeared in front of Anos, who prevented the war between demons and humans, was a
                    new

                <li> <strong>Synopsis</strong>
                    <hr> A new millennium begins in the southern part of the Jutland peninsula in Denmark. Thorfin was
                    bought by the landowner Ketil as a "slave" and engaged in land reclamation work on his farm.
                    Thorfinn
                    meets a young man there, Einar, who was also a slave like him. The encounter of Einar led Thorfinn
                    to
                    face the sins he had committed and began to find meaning in life. On the other hand, Canute, who
                    became
                    the King of England, attempted to extend his territory for the establishment of "the promised land."

                    This is "The Story of a True Warrior (Saga)." "The story of Atonement and Salvation (Saga)" that
                    lies
                    beyond the prologue.
